            <p><b>The Omnimatrix</b>, better known as the Omnitrix, was a watch-like device that attached to Ben Tennyson's wrist in the beginning of the series, and is the device that the franchise revolves around. The device allowed whoever wore it to alter their DNA at will, and transform into dozens of different alien species, each with their own unique abilities.</p>

            <div class="divider"></div>
            <p>In the first form that Ben encountered, the Omnitrix looked like a very big wristwatch, primarily black and grey in color, with a grey (or black) dial in the middle (like a watch face) which has a green hourglass shape (the intergalactic "peace" symbol, also on Plumber's Badges and Galvan Prime) on it. When Ben selects his aliens it shows the alien's silhouette. The prototype Omnitrix (before recalibration) in Omniverse looks the same as how it was in the Original Series. However, whenever Ben transforms into an alien form, the colors of the Omnitrix symbol that is located on the alien form have been changed from white and grey to green and black, due to the removal of the scratchguard. When it recalibrated, the Omnitrix gained a more watch-like shape, a green wristband, became smaller and sleeker, and the face dial became black and green. The inside of the hourglass shape glowed in different colors at certain moments. These colors signify the mode that the Omnitrix was presently in. When Ben is selecting his aliens it shows the alien's hologram standing on the core rather than the alien's silhouette.</p>

                <h5>Purpose</h5>
            <div class="divider"></div>
            <p>The Omnitrix was created by Azmuth as a tool of peace in an act of repentance following the destruction caused by his previous creation, Ascalon, a weapon of terrible power. The Omnitrix had a three-fold purpose:
            <ul style="list-style-type:disc">
                <li>It would promote inter-species understanding by allowing other beings to experience different ways of life.</li>
                <li>It would serve as a repository for the DNA of over a million different intelligent species, preserving them in the event that any of them should ever become extinct and bring them back.</li>
                <li>Secretly, Azmuth had another reason for creating the Omnitrix: he hoped that his estranged lover Zennith, who had left him as he created Ascalon, would learn of his change and come back to him.</li>
            </ul></p>
